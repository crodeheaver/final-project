# UCIM (Union College Intramurals Manager)

The student worker that manages intramurals for Union currently uses excel sheets to keep track of the games, stats, and things pertaining to the intramurals program. My goal is to create a web application using Node.js and Mongoose (Mongodb) to allow for easier management of the intramurals program.


Description
-----------

UCIM uses a Mongo database to keep track of players, teams, and games for the intramurals program.
